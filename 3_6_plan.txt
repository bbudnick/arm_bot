     Today? Unsure how to translate what Lindie and I have been working on 
     to meet Vadim's code in the middle 
    
^    Send result of IKinSpace to Arduino
|    Translate general vectors to physical angles and rotations 
|    Use pos set to communicate new positions
|    Establish home position angles via serial for each motor 
     Send series of positions to each motor via updated_communication.ino

Lingering quetsions: 
  1. How do we use the generalized vectors to get angles to send to the Arduino? 
  2.
