Project to create an arm to grasp a marker and write the first 10 letters of the English alphabet. 



Goal: use Dynamixel motors to control a robot arm via Arduino and MATLAB scripts. 
When requested, the arm will write the first 10 letters of the English alphabet
on a whiteboard no more than 16" distance from the base of the arm.
